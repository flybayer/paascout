## What is [PaaScout.io](http://PaaScount.io)?

PaaS platforms make it easy to manage infrastructure and deploy applications. Developers can handle app deployment independently, without needing to learn DevOps.

With so many Platform as a Service providers in the market, itâ€™s not easy to know where to start. We created a guide to compare modern PaaS providers using over 40 criteria, so you can make smart choices about your infrastructure.
